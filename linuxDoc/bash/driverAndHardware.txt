There are two type of devices. could plug and hot plug devices.
----------------------------------------------------------------
	Could plug	
	----------
		>> could plug devices are like expension card.This thing need 
        >> to plug in when machine turn off.

		>> Pci bus is most oftern used to connect sound card, network card, video card.
		>> To see what is attach on pci bus this is normaly our expension card
			* lspci
			* lspci -t		#This will gives us tree layout of devices

	Hot plug
	---------
		>> hot plug devices are like usb.
		>> To see usb bus or hot plug devices
			* lsusb


Devices Drivers
----------------
    To See a Network Card Module name (Could Plug devices) :
    ---------------------------------------------------------
        * lspci | grep Network
            >> Output : 02:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 31) 
        * lspci -vv -s 02:00.0
            >> This will show kernel modules
            >> Then remove and start module.

	* lsmod
		>> This command will gives all drivers or modules which currently are loaded.
		>> This will gives us  ==>> | module name | 
        >> size of moudle | how many devices useing it |
		>> If we want we can unload some drivers/module which is not using any devices.

	* modinfo [driver/module name]
		>> This will gives informataion about that driver like version, path etc.

	* rmmod [driver/module name]
		>> Ex: rmmod bluetooth
		>> This will unload bluetooth driver

	* insmod [driver/module path]
		>> To insert/load an module we need to spacify full path of that module.
		>> We can find path using "modinfo" command.

	[NOTE : We can do similer task using "modprob" command]
	
	* modprob --show-depends [driver/moudule name]
		>> Show all dependendcy of this module.




Show Hardware Temperature :
---------------------------
	* apt-get install lm-sensors
		>> By default kali have this.

	* sensors-detect
		>> This will detect hardware and after complite this 

		* sensors
			>> This will show result
