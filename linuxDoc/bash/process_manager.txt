Starting a program :
--------------------
    Foreground process
    ------------------
        * firefox
            >> This command will fire up firefox and make this a froeground process.

        * fg [process id]
            >> "jobs" command gives all background process with ID
            >> With that ID we can make any program foreground using "fg"


    Background process
    ------------------
        * jobs
            >> This will show all background process.
            >> To close any background process we can 
            >> make that program foreground using "fg [id]" and "ctrl + c"
            >> Or by using "kill" command.
        
        * firefox&
            >> This will fire up firefox and make this a background process.
        
        * bg
            >> we also can make a foreground process to background by pressing 
            >> "ctrl + z" this will pause the process. Now use "bg"


    Give priorities to process :
    ----------------------------
        * nice -n 19 process_name
            >> We can assignn nice value to a process to use proper cpu
            >> circle to run it. Nice value is between -19 to 19.
            >> -19 is highest priorities for maximux cpu circle
            >> and 19 is lowest priorities for lower cpu circle.

            >> To see nice value for any process use "ps -l"

        * renice -10 process_id
            >> To change nice value currently running process.



List all process
-----------------
	In "/proc" forder there are folders which have number on it current 
    those numbers are current running process. Those number are process 
    id number. To see what process is this goto any folder and run "readline exe"


	ps :
	----
         # -a   = list all process that run on terminal.
         # -x   = list all process that do not run on terminal.
         # -e   = list all demons process.
         # -u	= format the result with additional information like cpu%, mem%
         # -l	= list more information on process like nice value.
         # -f	= list process with full option

		* ps
			>> Show all process created by current shell 

		* ps -exu
		* ps  -axu
			>> Listing all runnin process.

		* pstree
			>> Show tree of process

	top :
	------
		* top
			>> show all current process running.
			>> "shift + F" we can sort process depending either 
            >> cpu or memory uses or something else.
			>> "u" we can search process running by a particular user.

			>> "shift + P" list all process according to cpu usage.
			>> "shift + M" list all process according to memory usage.
			>> "shift + W" for save top output inside "/etc/toprc".
			
			>> "1" show detail of indivisual cpu.
			>> "k" then "pid" to kill a process.
			>> "d" Change refresh time by default it is 3s.
			>> "c" list running process absulate path.	

			>> "n" reduce the number of process listed


    See GPU Usages for AMD Radeon :
    -------------------------------
        * radeontop
            >> If not install then install.



Kill a process
--------------
	* kill -l 
		>> List all signal to kill a prosess.
        >> we can use that name or id
        >> kill -2  =   ctrl + c option.
        >> kill -9  =   kill -KILL force to stop program.
        >> kill -15 =   default kill.

	* kill [PID]
	* kill -kill [PID]
		>> End a process.

	* killall -s 9 -u linux bash
		>> When we need to kill multiple same process we use killall.
		>> "-s" singnal to see all signal use "kill -l"
		>> "-u" user name and then name of process.
