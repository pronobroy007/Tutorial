Add user/guest 
---------------
	adduser username					=> This will make a guest user on kali.
	cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1		=> show all user
	su username							=> login as different user in terminal.
	
	
install tor
-------------
	apt-get install tor -y
	adduser username	
	open browser and download tor not in root user.


setup proxy
-------------
	>> nano /etc/proxychains.conf
	>> enable dynamic_chain 
	>> enable proxy_dns				=> This is resolv dns leaks.
	>> socks5 172.0.0.1 9050		=> end of file. This is tor default ip and port.
	
	
Staying Anonymous
------------------
	Here we using Tor default proxy
		>> service tor start							   => We start tor to use proxy not our own proxy.
		>> service tor status
		>> proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com			=> Here proxychains will hide your self.
		>> serarch dns leaks and see your ip address
	
	Here we using our own free proxy. This is a bit slow.
		>> Now serarch "free proxy socks5" and copy some proxy virsion, IP, port
		>> Then open "nano /etc/proxychains.conf"
		>> peast that proxy botton of that file.
		>> In proxychains.config file there are some example how to add those porxy.

	Using vpn we can open a port for home server.
	
	
	>> open "nano /etc/resolf.conf"
	>> In this file we have this "nameserver ip". It mean we are using our 
	>> ISP DNS server which can be detected.
	>> open browser search "opendns" and copy there dns server address 
	>> and use that ip as our dns ip
	>> You can use more than one dns.
	[NOTE : if we restart our network then we will get our default ISP DNS]
	
	
	>> goto "vpnbook.com" and download any certificate bundle
	>> And also see user name and password.
	>> In terminal goto where we extract our certification file.
	>> openvpn --config "use any certificate"
