    BETWEEN/NOT BETWEEN Example:
    ---------------------------- 
        SELECT * FROM Products
        WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20; 

        
        SELECT * FROM Products
        WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
         


        The following SQL statement selects all orders with an OrderDate BETWEEN '01-July-1996' and '31-July-1996':

        SELECT * FROM Orders
        WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #01/07/1996# AND #31/07/1996#;
        

        OR

        
        SELECT * FROM Orders
        WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';
        

    

    Like Example:
    --------------
            LIKE Operator	                    Description

        WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that start with "a"
        WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that end with "a"
        WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position
        WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position

            WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'; 

            >> CustomerName that have "or" in any position



    SQL IN/NOT IN Operator:
    ------------------------
        The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
        The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

        ----------
            SELECT * FROM Customers
            WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');


            SELECT * FROM Customers
