SQL GROUP BY Statement:
-----------------------
    The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions 
    (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.



Example:
--------
    SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
    FROM Customers
    GROUP BY Country;

    >> This SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country:




The SQL HAVING Clause:
-----------------------
    Example:
    --------
        SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
        FROM Customers
        GROUP BY Country
        HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;

        >> SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country. 
            Only include countries with more than 5 customers:


    
    Example:
    -------
        SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
        FROM (Orders
        INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
        GROUP BY LastName
        HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 10;

        >> This SQL statement lists the employees that have registered more than 10 orders
