
1.
	To work with database 1st create a database in mysql. 
	Example : create a database called "laravelapp"

2.
	Now connect database with leravel:
		goto ".env" file >> configer database.

3.
	Let's create a controller for database.
			*  php artisan make:controller DbController --resource
			>> This will create some extra functin in "DbController" class
			>> those function are : index(), create(), store(), show(), edit() etc.
	
	After create this controller we need to make Route for all those function like : 
			*  Route::get('post/index', 'DbController@index'); 
			>> this is for index and we also need to create all route for rest of function
			
			*  Route::resource('db', 'DbController');
			>>  This will create all functin that "DbController" have

	To see all route in terminal comment this
			*  php artisan route:list
		
4.
	Also crate a model for our app
			*   php artisan make:model Db -m
			>> Here "-m" mean we migrate this model. 

	This model is create in "app" folder "Db.php" and it also create a migrate in 
	"database/migration" and thier is a file "..create_dbs_table.php". Table name will be
	"dbs". If we want to change table name then open "db.php" and in 
	"class Db extends Model" use this	
		*  protected $table = 'language';

5.
	Then open this migration file and create some row in here:
	
		***********************************************
	    *  public function up()
		*  {
        *  	Schema::create('dbs', function (Blueprint $table) {
        *     		$table->increments('id');
        *     		$table->string('title');
        *     		$table->mediumText('body');
        *     		$table->timestamps();
        *  	});
		*  }
		***********************************************

6.
	Now migrate model using this comment:
			* php artisan migrate
		
	[NOTE: If there is any problem to migrate close mysql workbench and start again or create 
	database again and then migrate ]
 
		
*********************** 	Access Database ****************************
To insert, update or delete data we use "tinker"

In Terminal open "tinker" shell by this comment :
	*  php artisan tinker
	
Now we can interect with database/model :
	*  app\Db::count()
	
	>> Here "app\Db" mean in app folder Db.php file. It return total number of element
	>> Another importent think is we use '\' not forword slash
	
	
Now insert an element to the table "dbs"
	
	**************************************************
	*  $row = new app\Db();
	*  $row->title = "Assembly";
	*  $row->body = "This is Assembly language page";
	*  $row->save();
	**************************************************
	
>> In "laravelapp" database we create two row one "title" and one "body"
