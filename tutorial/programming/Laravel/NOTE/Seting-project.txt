goto "wamp/www" open cmd and put 

	* composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel laravelapp
 this commend to create a project folder named "laravelapp".
 
 
 Now open browser and goto "localhost/laravelapp" then browser will show all file and folder
 in that project folder which is not good. If we goto "localhost/laravelapp/public" this is 
 home page 
 
 
 In AppServiceProvider.php

	}
