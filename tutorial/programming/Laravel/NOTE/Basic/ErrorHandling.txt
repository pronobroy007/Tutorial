#Introduction:
------------------
	When you start a new Laravel project, error and exception handling is already 
	configured for you. The App\Exceptions\Handler class is where all exceptions 
	triggered by your application are logged and then rendered back to the user
	
#Configuration:
-------------------
	The debug option in your config/app.php configuration file determines how much 
	information about an error is actually displayed to the user. By default, this option 
	is set to respect the value of the APP_DEBUG environment variable, which is stored 
	in your ".env" file.
	
	For local development, you should set the APP_DEBUG environment variable to  true.
	In your production environment, this value should always be false. If the value is set to 
	true in production, you risk exposing sensitive configuration values to your application's 
	end users
