Current :
----------
    Number of electrons passing a given point in one second
    1 Amp = 1 Coulum of charge flowing through a certient point par second

Voltage : 
---------
    Differenc in electrical potencial energy, par unit of chrge, between tow points 
    Energy is ablity to do work and it is mesure in joules
    potencial energy = potencial ot do work.   
    battery is electrical potencial energy

    1 volt, is the force require to drive one coulum through a resister of one ohm in one second.
    1 coulum = 6,242,000,000,000,000,000 electorns par second.

    To power 1.5W lamp with 1.5V battery require one coulum per second.

Watt :
-------
    W = V * I
    W = V * V/R (I = V/R)
    1W = 1J transfer par second



Oms law :
----------
    V = I * R
    Voltage = Current * Resistance or 

    Current = Voltage / Resistance
    Resistance = Voltage / Current


LED :
-----
    Polarity :
    -----------
        Anode(+) and Cathode(-)
        Anode is learger leg and Cathode is shorter leg of LED

    Forward voltage :
    -----------------
        Every LED need creten voltage across them in right direction before any current can flow and start emiting light
