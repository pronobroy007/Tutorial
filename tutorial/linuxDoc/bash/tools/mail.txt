How MTA(Mail Tranfer Agent) work
---------------------------------
	>>	To send an email a client need an "email client". This 'eamil client' softwere call the MUA(Mail User Agent).
		Common MUA 'Mozila Thunderbird, Microsoft Outlook, ... ...
	
	>> 	This MUA have no idea how to send this mail to other end. What this MUA do is to send this mail
		to a spacific mail server using SMTP protocol.Which is known as MTA. This MTA decide what to do 
		with this message

	>> 	Then this MTA forword this massage usig SMTP protocol through the internet from MTA to MTA until it reach
		the destination MTA for recipient organization. If recever is in same organization this this massage
		will stay in seder MTA and wait for receiver to request. Same organization mean sending mail form
		"@gmail.com" to "@gmail.com" thos are local domain.

	>> 	This destination MTA transfer email to MDA(Message delivery Agent) usually the same system. This MDA 
		store messages and tell recever to request.

	>> 	Recever also connect to a MTA/MDA using MUA. When new message come to it's MTA it pull that message down.
		To do this it use any of two protocol POP3(Post Office Protocol V3), IMAP(Internet Message Access Protocal)
