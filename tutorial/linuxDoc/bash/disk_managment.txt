Find UUID for storage device :
------------------------------
	# This UUID need to create mount point in "/etc/fstab". This mount point will load 
 	# that partition when matchine start

	* ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid
		>> this will list the partition name (i.e. sda1, sda2) and 
        >> their uuids are listed. 

	* blkid
		>> The filesystems that has UUID are displayed. 
        >> A lot of loop devices are also listed 




List disk property :
---------------------
	* df -h
		>> df = Disk Free.
		>> List only mounted disk partition used, avallable, total space.

    * du -h -d 1
        >> This will show all file size in current folder.

	* du -sh [folder name]
		>> -h = Human readable format like 1K, 10M.
		>> show total size/space of that folder.

	* fdisk -l
		>> list all disk partition table 

	* lsblk
	* blkid -o list
		>> List all disk partition with Lable, UUID, Type, PartLable, PARTUUID




fdisk :
--------
	* fdisk [device name]
		>> "device name" == "/dev/sda" this is a disk. 
		>> If there is more than one disk then rest 
        >> will like "/dev/sdb", "/dev/sdc"  ... ...
		
		>> m = for help menu or all avallable option.
		>> p = print partition table. same as "fdisk -l"
		>> w = Save all changes and quite.
		>> q = quit and don't save.

		n = create new partiion :
		-------------------------
			>> It will ask for partition number, default will show avallable partition 
			>> number but if we have free space more then one place then select one.

			>> Then First sector is starting address of our new partition, 
			>> default will be starting addr of selected partition.

			>> Then Last sector is size of our new partition
			>> default will take entire. we can spacify our own size using +(K,M,G,T)
			>> +10G = 10gibe, +10T = 10tera
			
			>> write and save using "w"
			
			>> This will create an new entry in partition tablel but not assaign 
			>> any file system(NTFS, EXT4) on it
			

		d = delete partiion :
		---------------------
			>> select partition number to delete. 
            >> It mean which partition need to delete.
			>> save and quite using "w"

        t = to Change partition type :
        ------------------------------
            >> sesect partition number to change partition type
            >> such as for linux filesystem to linux swap or UFI



Assigning FileSystemm :
-----------------------
	* mkfs -f [type] [partition]
		>> -f = Spacify the type of filesystem to be built.
		>> type = ext*, ntfs, fat ... ... ...
		>> partition = select which partition like "/dev/sda1" or "/dev/sda2". 
		>> "fdisk -l" list all avallabel partition
    
    Another way :
    -------------
        * mkfs.exe* /dev/sda*
        * mkswap /dev/sda*
            >> For swap file type.
            >> "swapon" to on swap partition.


Name/Rename Partition lable :
-----------------------------
	* ls -l /dev/disk/by-level
		>> List all partition which have level on it.


	* sudo fatlabel /dev/sdxN my_label
		 >> for FAT 
	 
	* sudo ntfslabel /dev/sdxN my_label
		 >> for NTFS
	 
	* sudo exfatlabel /dev/sdxN my_label
		 >> for exFAT
	 
	* sudo e2label /dev/sdxN my_label
		>> for ext2/3/4
	 
	* sudo btrfs filesystem label /dev/sdxN my_label
		 >> for BTRFS





Disk Repaire :
--------------
	* fsck /dev/sdxN 
		>> fsck(file system check) is similler to "chkdisk" command in windows 
		>> This is use to repaire a disk. If any disk partition have any problem 
		>> to mount then fsck will try to repaire that parition fsck removes 
		>> those corrupted bits of data from the file system and places 
		>> them in the lost+found folder.

		>> To make "fsck" in boot time create "forcefsck" file in root folder ("/")
		[NOTE : Don't use this command on any mounted partition]



Defragment :
------------
	* e4defrag [partiion name/folder path]
	
	* e4defrag /
		>> This will defrag root directory

	* e4defrag /home/linux
		>> This will defrag a particular user directory
