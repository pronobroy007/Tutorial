Intro :
--------
	# There are three built in rules/chain INPUT OUTPUT FORWA
	# INPUT  	= trific which is comming form internet 
	# OUTPUT 	= trafic which is going form internet
	# FORWARD	= Packets passing through pc(like router)

	# Order of rules for eatch chain matter.
	# Make catch-all rule lase. catch-all rulr mean what happen when avobe all rule fail.
	# Make a catch-all rule : iptable -A FORWARD -J DROP -p tcp -i eth0



iptables options
----------------
	-s = source address.
	-d = destination address.
	-i = interface name.
	-p = protoclo (tcp, udp, smtp ...).
	-j = action(ACCEPT/DROP).
	-P = specify default policy for chain.
	-D = delete a rule for a chain.
	-R = relace a rule for a chain.
	-F = remove all rules for spacific chain.
	-L = list chain rules.
	-I = add rule top of chain.
	-A = append/add rule to end of chain.



Example :
----------
	* iptables -L				
		>> Show all rules

	* iptables -P FORWARD DROP 				
		>> change default policy ACCEPT to DROP for FORWARD CHAIN

	iptables -P FORWARD DROP -i eth0		
		>> -i which interface. you may have multiple eth.	

	* iptalbes -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.32 -j DROP	
		>> -A append a new rule.INPUT for which chain.  -s select an ip. -j DORP or ACCEPT
		>> Any request comming from that address will drop.

	* iptables -D INPUT 1				
		>> Delete 1st INPUT CHAIN rule.

	* iptables -I INPUT -s 192.168.1.32 -j ACCEPT	
		>> -I add top of chain and -A add last.

	* iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p tcp --distination-port 25 -j DROP
		>> -p for protocol. prot 25 use for mail. So we block all mail. For ssl "--distination-port 443"
		>> This is how we can create rule for spacific protocol.
	 
	* iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-reply -j DROP	
		>> This will dorp all ping request.

	* iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DORP		
		>>  This will drop all icmp request.
